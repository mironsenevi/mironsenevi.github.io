                                <p>On October 13, 2024, SpaceX conducted its fifth Starship flight test, which marked a
                                    significant achievement in the company's quest for reusability. This mission was
                                    notable
                                    for being the first time an orbital-class rocket was caught mid-air after launch.
                                    The
                                    Starship Ship 30 upper stage and Super Heavy Booster 12 lifted off from SpaceX's
                                    Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. <br><br>
                                    After successfully delivering the Starship upper stage into a suborbital trajectory,
                                    the
                                    Super Heavy booster executed a controlled return to its launch site. For the first
                                    time,
                                    it performed a "catch" maneuver using two massive robotic arms known as
                                    "Mechazilla." As
                                    it approached the launch pad, the booster slowed down and aligned itself with these
                                    arms
                                    before they closed around it, effectively capturing it mid-air. <br><br>
                                    This mission not only demonstrated advanced recovery techniques but also showcased
                                    SpaceX's commitment to making its launch systems fully reusable. Following this test
                                    flight, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson praised SpaceX's achievement as a significant
                                    step forward in aerospace engineering</p> <br>

                                <p>Kepler-452b, often referred to as "Earth's cousin," is a significant exoplanet
                                    discovered by NASA's Kepler mission in 2015. It is located approximately 1,400
                                    light-years away in the constellation Cygnus and orbits a star that is similar to
                                    our Sun, known as Kepler-452. This star emits about 20% more light than our star,
                                    providing Kepler-452b with slightly more solar energy than Earth receives <br><br>

                                    Kepler-452b has a radius approximately 1.6 times larger than Earth's, placing it in
                                    the category of "super-Earths." If its composition is rocky, its mass could be
                                    around five times greater than Earth's, resulting in a gravitational force that
                                    would make a person weigh significantly more on its surface24. The planet completes
                                    an orbit around its star every 384.8 days, which is just over one Earth year, and
                                    resides within the "Goldilocks zone"â€”the region around a star where conditions may
                                    be right for liquid water to exist. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Its position in the habitable zone suggests that it could support liquid water,
                                    provided it has a suitable atmosphere. However, the exact nature of its atmosphere
                                    remains unknown; it could range from being rocky and Earth-like to having a thick
                                    gaseous envelope similar to Neptune15. Studies indicate that if Kepler-452b
                                    maintains conditions similar to those on Earth, it could remain in the habitable
                                    zone for another 3 billion years, allowing ample time for life to potentially
                                    develop5.</p> <br>
